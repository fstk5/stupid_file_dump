# stupid_file_dump
some stupid projects and files that I'm working on for some reason
idk why I'm even coding these
if you're wondering why I put this on github it's cause I'm too lazy to carry a USB around with me


THIS IS THE INDEV BRANCH
Steps to code:
1. Switch to indev branch.
2. Code and push code to indeb using git.
4. Make a pull request after code is finalized to merge branches.
